## Strategic Market Entry: France & Teleradiology

### Why France and teleradiology

* Partnership with a **leading French teleradiology provider** offers:
    * Real workflows and real data
    * Faster validation than hospital-by-hospital sales
    * Alignment with EU radiologist shortages
* France provides a strong **EU MDR anchor** for future expansion

---

## Regulator-Safe Architecture (EU MDR)

### Assistive-only design

* **Step 1 (Detection):**
    * Probabilistic signals
    * Non-diagnostic
* **Step 2 (Vector search):**
    * Contextual retrieval only
    * No reasoning
* **Step 3 (LLM):**
    * Drafting only
    * No new findings
    * Strict schemas
    * Mandatory clinician validation

### Core principles

* LLM is never a source of truth
* Full traceability
* Human responsibility is never transferred

---

## Regulatory Outlook (EU MDR)

* Likely **Class IIa** if strictly assistive
* Design defensively for **Class IIb**

### Key expectations

* ISO 14971 risk management
* Annex XIV clinical evaluation (workflow KPIs, not just accuracy)
* Explainability and auditability
* Post-market surveillance and drift monitoring

### Highest risks

* LLM hallucinations
* Silent workflow influence
* Vector search perceived as reasoning

---

## Fundraising Strategy

* Raise as **"clinical workflow infrastructure with embedded AI"**, not as a generic AI or diagnostic startup
* Emphasize:
    * Workflow impact over raw model accuracy
    * Regulatory readiness from day one
    * Clear ROI for clinical partners

### Staged fundraising approach

* **Pre-seed**
    * LOI or pilot with a French teleradiology partner
    * Narrow clinical scope
    * Strong use of public and non-dilutive funding

* **Seed (€500k–€1.5M)**
    * MVP in production
    * Initial clinical validation
    * EU MDR groundwork (risk management, clinical evaluation plan)

* **Series A (€5M–€10M)**
    * CE marking
    * Commercial scale-up
    * Second vertical (dermatology)

* Heavy use of **non-dilutive funding**:
    * BPI France
    * France 2030
    * EU grants

## US–France Operating Model

### Corporate structure

* **Delaware C-Corp (parent)**
    * IP ownership
    * Fundraising
    * Core engineering and product development
* **French subsidiary**
    * Clinical operations
    * Data contracts
    * Pilots and early revenue
    * EU MDR execution

### Strategic narrative

* **United States** = product velocity, AI talent, venture access
* **France** = clinical access, regulatory anchor, first market

This dual setup is positioned as a **strategic advantage**, not a split focus.

## Raising Money in France with a Delaware C-Corp

* A Delaware C-Corp **can raise from French investors**
* Works best with:
    * French VCs
    * Strategic investors
    * Family offices
* More difficult with:
    * Retail angels relying on French tax incentives (e.g. IR-PME)
* Public grants typically flow to the **French subsidiary**, not the US parent
* Mixed US / French syndicates often prefer **priced seed rounds** over SAFEs
